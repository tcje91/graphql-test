# GraphQL Experimentation Project

A simple full-stack project created to practice using GraphQL.

It has an Express server connected to a MongoDB Atlas instance on the back end, and uses React and Apollo on the front end.

The app currently serves as a way to view and add to a database of films and film directors.
